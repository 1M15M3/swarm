@chapter Background

The primary objective of Swarm is to provide a sufficiently 
decentralized and redundant store of Ethereum's public record, in 
particular to store and distribute ƒêapp code and data as well as 
block chain data.

From an economic point of view, it allows participants to efficiently
pool their storage and bandwidth resources in order to provide the
aforementioned services to all participants.

These objectives entails the following design requirements:

@enumerate
@item distributed storage, inclusivity, long tail of power law
@item flexible expansion of space without hardware investment decisions, unlimited growth
@item zero downtime
@item immutable unforgeable verifiable yet plausibly deniable
@item no single point of failure, fault and attack resilience
@item censorship resistance, permanent public record
@item self-managed sustainability via incentive system
@item efficient market driven pricing. tradeable trade off of memory, persistent storage, bandwidth (and later computation)
@item efficient use of the blockchain by swarm accounting protocol
@item deposit-challenge based implementation of a trustless trust network
